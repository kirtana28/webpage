<p>Scooby-Doo is an American media franchise owned by Warner Bros. Discovery and created in 1969 by writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears through their animated series, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, for Hanna-Barbera (which was absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation in 2001). The series features 4 teenagers: Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Shaggy Rogers, and their talking dog named Scooby-Doo, who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps, while traveling using a brightly colored van called the "Mystery Machine".[1] The Franchise has several live-action films and shows.</p>

    <p>Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?<br>
    We got some work to do now<br>
    Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?<br>
    We need some help from you now<br><br>
    Come on Scooby Doo, I see you<br>
    Pretending you got a sliver<br>
    But you're not fooling me, 'cause I can see<br>
    The way you shake and shiver</p>
